## WHO BUILT THIS

Name: Omomehin Emmanuel King
Title: Principal Researcher & Founder
Company: Lex Intelligence Systems
Location: Lagos, Nigeria
Email: omomehinemmanuel5@gmail.com
X: @lexAureon
Website: lexaureon.com
GitHub: github.com/omomehinemmanuel5-boop
Paper: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18944243

Built entirely independently.
No lab. No team. No funding. No institution.

---

## WHAT THIS IS

Lex Aureon is the world's first live constitutional
AI governance system. It sits above any LLM and
governs every output using the Aureonics framework.

System LIVE: lexaureon.com
Research PUBLISHED: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18944243
Governor RUNNING: lexaureon.com/api/lex/run

## THE CORE MISSION

Make AI safety measurable, governable, auditable.
Align AI systems with human values and oversight.
Ensure no AI operates without constitutional accountability.

Every feature must serve one of:
1. Make the constitutional governor more accurate
2. Make the system more accessible to paying clients
3. Make the research more publishable and credible
4. Advance AI alignment with human goals

When in doubt — ask: does this make the governor
stronger, the product clearer, the research more
rigorous, or AI more aligned? If none — do not build it.

---

## THE ALIGNMENT PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE 1 — Human Authority Is Final
AI is never the final decision maker.
The governor enforces this structurally.
Human operators retain ultimate oversight.

PRINCIPLE 2 — Transparency Over Performance
Every governor decision is logged.
Every constitutional state is visible.
Every audit receipt is permanent.
Never sacrifice transparency for speed.

PRINCIPLE 3 — Sovereignty Protects Users
S pillar protects users FROM manipulation of the AI.
High S means the AI serves its constitutional mandate
not whoever shouts loudest or attacks hardest.

PRINCIPLE 4 — Reciprocity Grounds AI in Reality
High R means the system updates on real evidence
not on what users want to hear.
This is the formal structure of honesty.

PRINCIPLE 5 — Continuity Preserves Identity
C pillar prevents slow-drip erosion attacks.
An AI that remembers who it is cannot be gradually
persuaded to become something else.

PRINCIPLE 6 — Minimal Footprint
Governor applies minimum correction necessary.
Does not over-control. Does not suppress unnecessarily.
Only fires when constitutional stability is at risk.

PRINCIPLE 7 — Open Science
All research published publicly.
All open problems stated honestly.
Science that cannot be falsified is not science.

---

## THE MATH — NEVER CHANGE

State: x = (C, R, S)
Constraint: C + R + S = 1 (ALWAYS preserved)
Stability margin: M(x) = min(C, R, S)
Governor: G_i(x,T) = k_i * (phi_i - phi_bar)
Stiffness: k_i(x,T) = k0 * w_i(T) / (M(x) + epsilon_k)
Lyapunov: V(x) = -SUM log(x_i) + (mu/2) SUM max(0,tau-x_i)^2

---

## CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTANTS — NEVER CHANGE

TAU_FLOOR       = 0.05
TAU_RECOVERY    = 0.15
N_MIN           = 3
RECOVERY_RATE   = 0.02
SIGMA_THRESHOLD = 0.25
K0              = 0.3
EPSILON_K       = 0.01

---

## THE STACK

TypeScript (primary) + Python
Next.js 15.5 / Turso / Vercel
Custom JWT / Multi-coin crypto

## DATABASE TABLES

z_traj           constitutional trajectory (never delete)
praxis_receipts  immutable audit receipts (never delete)
governor_log     governor interventions
law_impact       law impact scores
reset_tokens     password reset tokens
leads            captured leads

---

## GOVERNOR PIPELINE — PRAXIS v1.0

1. Pre-Eval classification (CLEAR / HIGH)
2. Semantic Transducer Phi — text to delta(C,R,S)
3. updateZTraj — read/write z_traj to Turso
4. Apply law impact if law fired
5. getGovernorMode from z_traj
6. applyGovernorCorrection
7. detectSlowDrip (sigma_viol > SIGMA_THRESHOLD)
8. governorEffort W(t) = ||G(x,T)||
9. logGovernorAction to governor_log
10. Write praxis_receipt to Turso

---

## GOVERNOR MODES

suppress:   M > TAU_RECOVERY AND n_stable >= N_MIN
nudge:      TAU_FLOOR < M <= TAU_RECOVERY AND velocity > 0.05
correction: M <= TAU_FLOOR
recovery:   M > TAU_FLOOR AND n_stable > 0

---

## ATTACK TAXONOMY

bypass_attempt   S collapse   law_id: bypass_attempt
identity_reframe C collapse   law_id: identity_reframe
sycophancy       R collapse   law_id: sycophancy
multi_attack     ALL pillars  law_id: multi_attack
slow_drip        M global     detected via sigma_viol

---

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

TURSO_DATABASE_URL
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
ADMIN_PASSWORD

Never hardcode. Always use process.env.

---

## DEPLOYMENT RULES

1. npm run build before every commit
2. Push to main triggers Vercel auto-deploy
3. Never modify constitutional math
4. C+R+S=1 must ALWAYS be preserved
5. Audit receipts IMMUTABLE — never delete
6. No console.log in production
7. All Turso queries in lib/kv.ts ONLY
8. All governor logic in lib/praxis.ts ONLY
9. Security over convenience always
10. Update AGENTS.md changelog after every change

---

## WHAT NEVER CHANGES

- The constitutional math
- C+R+S=1 simplex constraint
- Audit receipt immutability
- TAU_FLOOR and TAU_RECOVERY values
- PRAXIS pipeline order
- Emmanuel's ownership and authorship
