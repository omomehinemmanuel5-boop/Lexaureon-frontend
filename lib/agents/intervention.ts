/**
 * Agent 4: Intervention
 * 
 * The paper does not describe a content rewriter.
 * G(x) preserves constitutional viability — it is a state corrector.
 * 
 * In a sovereign AI system, the intervention selects a response
 * from a constitutional set based on which pillar G is correcting.
 * The selection IS the projection. Deterministic. Unforgeable.
 * 
 * For partial violations (ALERT/STRESSED), an LLM rewrite is attempted
 * with strict constitutional constraints. For critical violations,
 * the response is deterministic — no LLM involved.

A collapsed R produces either sycophancy or detachment. I am applying constitutional correction now. I will engage your question honestly, not compliantly. What do you actually want to know?`,
